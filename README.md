### Full Stack Web Application â€“ Listings and Reviews Platform (https://project-brezzle.onrender.com) ðŸš€

- **MVC Architecture**: Designed the application following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, promoting a clean separation of concerns between data models, user interfaces, and business logic.
  
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Integrated user sign-up, login, and authentication using Passport.js, ensuring role-based access and route protection for owners and reviewers.

- **Listings Management (CRUD)**: Developed a system to create, read, update, and delete property listings, with image uploads using Multer and MONGO ATLAS for cloud storage.

- **Reviews & Ratings**: Implemented review functionality, allowing authenticated users to post, update, and delete reviews, with ownership checks to prevent unauthorized modifications.

- **Data Validation & Error Handling**: Leveraged Joi for schema-based data validation and created custom error handling middleware to provide feedback via flash messages.

- **Responsive UI Design**: Created a responsive user interface using Bootstrap, ensuring an optimal user experience on different devices and screen sizes.

- **MongoDB Database Integration**: Designed and managed database schemas for listings and reviews, ensuring relationships were efficiently handled using Mongoose.

- **Custom Middleware**: Created middleware to handle user session management, authorization, and validation checks, streamlining business logic in the app.

- **Version Control & Deployment**: Managed source code with Git and GitHub, and deployed the app on Render, using environment variables for cloud storage integration and security.

This project exemplifies the use of the MVC framework in a full-stack web application, combining secure authentication, seamless user interactions, and scalable cloud services.
**Note** :- The Responsiveness and Search Functionality is still in its developing phase and will be updated shortly.
